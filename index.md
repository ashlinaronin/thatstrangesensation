#PART ONE 

Lately, every time A ascended, she felt on the verge of passing out. About two meters from the surface, she’d find herself needing to grasp onto the inflater nozzle of her BCD in order to remind her body of the task at hand. The water would squeeze her, the churning, womb-like sounds surrounding her, disorienting her. The sun, filtered by the water into individual rays, would hit her like a spotlight, making her shield her eyes even as she felt herself hungrily drawing toward it.
	
And now she finds herself on the surface, back in her right mind, back on solid ground, which is in fact the choppy surface of the water. The sun steady, the physics standard. Escaped. Just a weird sensation was all.

Ever since she was a beginner diver, she’d felt a whiff of this sensation, but in the past few weeks it’s become stronger every dive. Glancing around to make sure her team is well, she actually wonders—if she were to let herself go on autopilot during ascension, allow her mind wander even just a bit, would she make it? Or would she pass out, sink to the bottom, die immediately, even before her colleagues could swim down to rescue her. 

*What an unscientific thought*. Likely she was becoming dizzy as a result of a slight physiological malfunction. An inner ear issue. Or maybe it was simply that this feeling mimicked the chemicals of not wanting to wake up from a good dream—it was so peaceful under there after all, so cozy, meditative. Your mind couldn’t be scattered—the water directed your focus, plied your attention toward what it wanted to show you.

“My god, I know how you feel,” her colleague, E, tells her as they unsuit back on the boat. E grunts as her tank clinks into its holder. “Sometimes I just don’t want to leave that world.” 

“Maybe that’s all it is,” A replies, but still she can’t explain why the sensation is getting stronger, or—could she say—worse?

Two hours later she is entering today’s data into the Thai governmental database. She and her team of interns had completed a fish survey and noted this bounty: forty-five butterfly fish, nine bream, five parrot fish, three angel fish, twenty-five wrasse, forty-five cardinal fish, and one soap fish. Still much fewer snapper than she’d like to be seeing, but the other fishes were doing well.

E types away beside her, probably messaging with some prospective intern or resident, an eager undergraduate or beleaguered graduate student, desperately looking for a suitable site to host them, an exciting Southeast Asian experience that would allow them to flex their new research skills.  A storm has rolled in. A’s nostrils are alerted to a metallic smell as large raindrops begin to fire away on the roof as if they mean to put a hole in it. A feels as if the space has become smaller, as if the world would be happy to do them in.

A leans her forehead on her hand, rubs her temples. “I’ve got a bit of a headache now,” she says. Her colleague turns toward her, frowns. 
	
“Take a paracetemol,” E says and, sighing, turns back to her computer. Then she groans. “This student wants to bring his girlfriend. But she’s not going to do any research. She just wants to hangout. She won’t take up another bed, he says. I don’t see why she has to pay.” She rolls her eyes.

A gets up and heads to the kitchen to get a drink of water. On her fourth step, a curtain comes over her vision and all she can see is black. “I’m going blind,” she says as she collapses to the floor.

aWhen she wakes up, E is standing over her. Her face looks old, and the geometry of her face evokes an ancient math. A is sure, then, that there have been hundreds of people throughout human history that looked exactly like E.

And then she feels her heart beating, faster than it should be beating. Her breath is deep and rapid at the same time, as if she can’t get enough air. But her breath moves in and out, her heart is beating, and she can see. 

“I’m okay,” she says.

“My god, what is wrong with you?” E yells, her Russian accent really coming out now. “Do you want me to call an ambulance?”

“No, no,” she says. “I just stood up too fast I think. Something going a little off with my circulation lately, maybe my blood pressure.”

Maybe I’m fucking pregnant, she thinks. *Fucking pregnant, that’s a funny phrase.* 
“Dude, go home,” E says. “Take the day off.”

“But new students are coming, I have to orient them.” 

“Honey, take some time *off*.” 

—

A couple hours later A is in her house, in her bed, behind the mosquito net. Her headache has faded and she feels fine. The storm has passed away, leaving behind thin, shifting, planes of air. She’s reading a dense book about water and how to interpret it. She’s enjoying the language, but can’t process much meaning from it. She puts the book down and looks at her nightstand. Two pregnancy tests rest there, staring up at her with two all-white eyes. No results. *How is this possible?

Pregnancy was unlikely, as she and her various partners on the island always used condoms, but you never knew. So she could understand a positive result and she could understand a negative result but a non-result was perplexing to say the least. Two different tests from two different companies. 
*Just a little low on iron from my last period. Something, something like that.* 

It is barely five o clock. A breeze blows in and a rodent scampers across her roof. The cicadas are quieting down to a low, tired, scratching, only needing to cool themselves down a little in this breezy landscape. 
	
>“We will look at water as the subject. Mammals and insects are interesting, but they will only earn their place in this book to the 
extent that they can explain the behavior, the signs and symbols of water.”

She puts the book down and falls asleep. She sleeps 12 hours. At 5 am a gecko lands on the wall of her bungalow just outside her head and calls out, loud and clear, “unh unh, unh unh, unh unh,” and she jolts awake, thinking the gecko is in her bed, that someone put it in her bed to wake it up, but there’s no one in her house, not even a gecko. 

She can’t believe she slept 12 hours.

*Maybe I am fucking pregnant.*

Suddenly she feels tough and lichenous, tucked away inside herself from whatever might be happening outside.

—

On her motorbike drive to work, a rabid dog lunges toward her, causing her to swerve sharply. After driving off a safe distance, she stops and looks back at it. It lies in the middle of the road, sunning.

She gets to the lab before E and spends a quiet morning drinking coffee and looking over the data. The coral bleaching is getting worse and what to do, what to do about that. 50% bleached already and it’s only the beginning of the hot season. At some point in her meager little life, she’d decided that the best thing she could do was have this field station and report the data. Tell the authorities. Alert people in power. Bolster the science, strengthen the argument. Not shut up. Perhaps she should do more. 

E enters the room with a clanging of bags and various attachments. Her helmet, which is attached to her arm, falls off and rolls toward A. 

Her eyes go wide and she feigns anger. “My god, what are you doing here?”

“What do you mean?” A says. 

“I thought you’d take the day off.” 

“Oh I’m fine,” she says. 

—

Two hours later they’re diving again. Today, perhaps out of E’s concern, it’s been determined that A will be divemaster for two of the more experienced students. That way, they can cover some of the more routine data gathering and A can be free to focus on her pet research project, which tests whether smaller solitary corals are less resistant to bleaching than larger solitary corals.  

Another group lays out the transects while the three of them hang out and look at coral. She breathes out and sinks closer in to some branching coral, the home of twenty or so baby white and yellow butterfly fish, who dart in and out like bees. She wishes she were doing a fish survey so that these lovely, tiny fish could be counted. If only their presence could be felt, could matter in the world. But probably they don’t care either way, probably that doesn’t matter to them. 

Now it’s time to go and she motions to the students to go ahead of her. With their underwater camera they take a picture of the transect measuring tape every 50 cm. Back at the lab they will need to go through every one of these 300 pictures and identify the coral just to the left of the transect. She removes her underwater slate from her BCD pocket and begins counting. Everything is slow, deliberate, meditative. She breathes slowly. It’s arduous counting all the solitary corals—there are so many. The students’ frog kicks are too frequent, they are going too fast—almost out of her sight now. No matter, they are safe and experienced. She finishes her survey and meets them at the end of the third transact right at the 60 minute mark. Together they reel up the transacts, spiders assuming the thread of their web back into their abdomens. She directs one of the students to take the transect bag and hook it to her kit. The three of them look at each other in the eyes and A makes the hand signal for “let’s ascend”—a thumb’s up. 
	
She doesn’t think about the strange sensation. She’s thinking about the data she gathered and about what conclusions she might begin to draw. Slowly, slowly she swims up, not even needing to think moving her feet, just willing herself up. And then, at three meters from the surface, once again, it hits.

—

The pressure is more intense this time, the movements of the water like a thousand little flies distracting her attention. The light hits and she feels the heat of the sunrays on her body. The rays form a cone, which twists around her, and she is an unwilling dancer, moving her limbs oddly, floating six inches above the ground in the middle of the stage. 

And then she is elsewhere. Her face is naked—no regulator. She feels sand in her nose and on her lips. She sputters, rubs her nose with her index and thumb, sticks out her tongue. Opens her eyes. She’s on the beach. Or a beach, rather. She doesn’t recognize the topography of this beach, with its thick forest, its meters of white sand. All the beaches on her island are short, with sparse, low vegetation a few pieces of trash strewn about. This beach is pristine. A breeze tumbles down the white sand, unobstructed by a single other person. She is alone.
